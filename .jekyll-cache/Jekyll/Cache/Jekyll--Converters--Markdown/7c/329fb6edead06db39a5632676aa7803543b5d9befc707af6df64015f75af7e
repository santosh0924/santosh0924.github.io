<p>The problem statement of this project to analyze media reports on Airline safety and present results using data visualization techniques. The media reports about airline safety do not truly reflect to the facts and data. The statistics promoted by media could be misleading and it is justified using six data visualization trends. Different visualization techniques were used to create graphs using Tableau and presented them to different set of audience.</p>

<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>For the final presentation, I had six visualization graphs. Three of the graphs had information about airline accident trends in recent years and other three graphs had information about the positive trends in airline industry. Since the information is presented to uninformed audience, I had graphs like comparison of air fare price with common goods like movie ticket, lodging, restaurant which can be easily related by everyone. When the data is presented about airline, there may be questions among the audience about other common method of transportation that is via road. Hence, I had graphs comparing Airline vs Road accidents to answer any question the audience might have. The colors added to graphs we carefully noted so that there werenâ€™t too many added. The labels were added to visualization where it might be useful for audience. I added animations to show important trends or data.</p>

<p>To prepare the data for visualization, I had to gather raw data from different sources. In addition to accidents dataset, I had to look for US airfare price, US airline traffic data, US airline arrival times. Having data about arrival times can give positive look. The data was consciously collected so that different horizons about airlines can be determined. As we know, travel by road might take more time when the traffic is more. The data was consciously searched and gather to prove that airline travel is reliable where around 94% of flights arrived on time. The data visualized had some information that was not important so I had to remove the unnecessary information using visualization tools.</p>

<p>When the data is presented to internal audience, more details specifically about US airlines can be added. For example, in one of the previous presentation, I had graph comparing the total departed seats by airline which can be useful for internal audience to see which airline is doing better. But not all general audience may be interested in detail about specific airline because they tend to look all airline carrier as same. Some of the graphs when presented to internal group may not be explained in detail as everyone is aware of the concepts. But when it is presented to general audience, the graphs should be explained in detail as it would be too much for them to digest. The type of graph is also important when presented to general audience. They should be able to perceive it easily and quickly. For example, just providing the percent increase visual about airfare would be sufficient instead of showing the actual price in different years.</p>
