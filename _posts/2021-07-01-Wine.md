## Project Summary
Wine consumption has increased in recent years and is commonly used beverage globally. There are some studies that suggests that moderate consumption of wine is good for heart. The quality of wine is important for consumers to preserve their health and to producers to remain competitive in market. Wine industries are applying new techniques and are implementing methodologies to make the process efficient. Hence, industries are looking to produce good quality wine with minimal cost. Analyzing wine quality is important to maintain human health. The chemical properties present in different type of wine are same, but the quantity of each chemical would make for different type of wine. Historically, testing and quality assurance of wine could not be achieved due to lack of resources and technology. With the advent of machine learning techniques, wines can be classified these days and the chemical properties can be analyzed in detail which helps to reduce cost.

The proposed technique analyzes wine dataset. The data is preprocessed and cleaned. Exploratory Data Analysis is performed for visualization where key insights on data is graphically represented. Outliers in the data are removed and correlation between features are determined. Different machine learning models are used to determine accuracy. The model with best result is selected for further processing. Performance of the model is improved by tuning the model parameters.

## Problem Statement
Consumption of wine has grown overall. One of the studies says that wine consumed in 2018 is 9% more that was consumed 18 years ago. US topped wine consumption globally as per reports in 2018. In US, commonly produced wines are from California. There are many varieties of wine and there are some festivals specifically for wine where different varieties can be tasted. The quality of wine is determined by the balance in its chemicals, and this differs for each type – Red and White. For white, alcohol or Sugar and acidity should match. For Red wine, alcohol, acidity, and tannins should be in balance. Another important factor that impacts quality of wine is intensity and finish. High quality wines have long lasting flavors that can be felt after they are swallowed.

Wine quality can be determined with sensory or physiochemical tests. The problem with sensory test is the need for human intervention. Also, the process involved in sensory test is huge where multiple tests have to be carried out for chemical properties. It is time consuming process and is expensive. If the wine quality is not good, there process has to be started from beginning which is again very costly.

Wine industries can use predictions from the model to improve wine quality. This helps certification companies to understand the factors that is required for quality of wine and let consumers decide when purchasing it.
    

### Dataset
The dataset is selected from Kaggle.

## Data Exploration
The dataset has 13 variables, they are –
Type – Wine type which is Red or White
Fixed acidity – The acids present in wine which can be citric, malic, tartaric and succinic. It impacts the taste of wine. Higher acidity would make the wine tase sour.
Volatile acidity – It is the acetic acid in wine. Wine would have unpleasant taste when acetic acid is more.
Citric acid – Similar to volatile acidity. This provides good flavors and freshness to wine when it is in small quantities.
Residual sugar – Sugar or Sweetness present in wine after fermentation.
Chlorides – This is the amount of salt in wine.
Free sulfur dioxide – Sulfur dioxide that is not reacted and it protects the wine.
Total sulfur dioxide – The portion of sulfur dioxide that is present in wine and other bound chemical in wine.
Density – It will be more when wine is sweeter.
pH – This describes the acidity level.
Sulphates – It maintains flavor and freshness of wine.
Alcohol – Presence of alcohol content in wine.
Quality – Predictor value which ranges from 3 to 9. 3 being low quality and 9 is best quality.

There are some columns with missing values and they need to be replaced. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Wine quality value distribution

Quality score ranges from 3 to 9 where 9 is the best quality wine. From above, it can be seen that dataset is imbalanced where majority of the wine data available is of quality between 5 and 7.

Quality vs wine type confirms the records available are evenly distribute. Wine type does not have impact on quality

Above shows outliers in fixed acidity, free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide. Hence, they need to be corrected.

## Model Selection and Evaluation
Predictor variable quality has values ranging from 3 to 9. The first step in model selection is to select performance metric. Since, the dataset is imbalanced, the metric chosen to evaluate the model is ROC AUC (receiver operating characteristic curve). Some of the machine learning models and techniques do not support ROC-AUC metric for multiclass variable. In such case, each of the predictor values has to be fed separately into the model to evaluate the score. To reduce the effort, I have grouped quality values 3 to 5 as average, 6 to 9 as good and converted them to binary for it to be used in the models. After converting to binary, good wine data is 3998 and average wine data is 2320. Label encoder is used of the same.
For model selection, the dataset is split in train and test data. 80% of the data is selected for training and 20% for test. The train and test data are normalized using standard scaler.

The models used for training are Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier, SGD Classifier and Logistic Regression.

Random forest model has the highest roc-auc score with 89%. Hence, it is selected for further performance tuning. Random Forest model is tuned with hyper parameters using Grid Search CV. The parameters the were chosen are estimators, criterion and max_features. The Grid SearchCV on Random Forest classifier improved the ROC-AUC score to 91%.
