## Project Summary
This project is about data analysis on Cars dataset. The goal of the project was to combine cars data from 3 different sources, combine them using common key and perform analysis on that.

Data sources:
1. Flat file (CSV) source - Kaggle.com
2. Website data source - [Data source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_automobiles)
3. API data source - [Data source](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/GetMakesForVehicleType/car?format=json)


The flat file source is first cleaned and formatted. The data from website is then read and formatted. Cars data from API is then read and formatted. 

The data from three sources are stored in CSV file. They are merged by Make and Model and are loaded in sqlite database. Data visualization is be performed on the combined data.
