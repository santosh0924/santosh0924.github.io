## Project Summary
Netflix needs no introduction, it is a streaming service that allows members to watch a wide variety of contents like movies, TV shows, documentaries and more. Netflix allows us to enjoy unlimited ad-free viewing of the contents. It was founded in 1997 and has become $100 billion company in 20 years.

The number of movies has decreased by over 2,000 titles since 2000 while the number of TV shows has nearly tripled.

Some important variables will be analyzed to perform exploratory data analysis and also predict the number of Movies and TV shows that will be added in 2020.

## Contents
1. Statistical questions
2. Analyzing important variables
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) outcome
4. Prediction

## Statistical questions 
Analyze the contents available in different countries and see which countries produce more movies and TV shows.
In which month are the contents added more?
What is the duration of the contents?
What are the top categories or genre?
What are the types of contents and their rating?
How many contents will be added in 2020?
